# google-photos-scripts
## A set of scripts i created to
1. Create a file containing filenames + id of all media files in my google photos account
2. Create a file containing all filenames from my local windows Pictures folder
3. Compare and see which photos are extra in google
4. Download the images that are not in local computer but in google

These scripts can be used individually or in collection for other batch operations on google photos

## Pre-requisites 
Create a google api client id and secret file. refer google docs in https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2?hl=en
The script assumes you have already saved the client id/secret in the file ```client_secret.json``` locally

## Step 1 Get list of files from google
```
Script: google-photo-name-downloader.py
Output: google_image_list.txt
format: csv
fields: filename,id
```

## Step 2 Get list of files from local compter (in my case C:\Users\Mangalraj\Pictures)
```
Script: print-files-in-dir.py
Output: file_image_list.txt
format: csv
fields: filename
```

## Step 3 Compare both list and create a diff file containing images extra in google account
```
Script: diff_image_calculator.py
Input1: file_image_list.txt
Input2: google_image_list.txt
Output: op_image_list.txt
format: csv
fields: filename,id
```

## Step 4 Download all images from the list
```
Script: google-photo-downloader.py
Input: op_image_list.txt
Output: All images mentioned in op_image_list.txt, downloaded and saved in current directory

Note: The filename field of the op_image_list.txt is not used. its there just because its the format generated by diff_image_calculator.py script
```
